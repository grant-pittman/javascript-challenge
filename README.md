## Background

In this exercise, I am working for `ALIENS-R-REAL`, a non-profit dedicated to getting the truth out about the existance of aliens using eye witness reports. 

There's a catch though - it can only be done using d3.js, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 


## Your Task

###  Automatic Table and Date Search

* Using a provided HTML starter file, I wrote JavaScript code that appends a table to the page and then adds a new row of data for each UFO sighting. 

* Created a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
